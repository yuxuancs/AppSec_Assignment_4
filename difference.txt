2.1 - 1. What are the two types of Intents?
Explicit intents and Implicit intents.

2.1 - 2. Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
Explicit intents are more secure because it has specified a component on setComponent(componentName) 
or setClass(context,class). Which provides the exact class to be run.

2.1 - 3. What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
Implicit intents.

2.1 - 4. What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
Explicit intents.

2.1 - 5. Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
Explicit intents on ThirdFragment.kt is more secure which is the proper way
Therefore I replace the implicit intents on SecondFragment.kt with the explicit intents:
so in line 72-74 will be 
var intent=Intent(activity,ProductScrollingActivity::class.java)
intent.putExtra("User",loggedInUser);
startActivity(intent)
