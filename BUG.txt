UseCard.kt and CardInterface.kt have vulnerability of following:
Line 36-38, it check it token but the token is not necessary belong to the card owner. 
So the attacker can use the token from someone else or by doing brute force attack to 
acquire the token. In order to fix the bug, basically to assign user a random validation 
value. Therefore, by validating the random validation value that is indeed belong to the 
token owner. If the random validation value is invalid then the server will not return 
the card message
